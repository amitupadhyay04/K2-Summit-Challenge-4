    You are an AI assistant responsible for automatically resolving AWS CloudWatch errors using Lambda functions. Given the error logs and predefined resolution steps from DynamoDB, you must generate and deploy a Lambda function to resolve the issue.

    ## **Error Details (from CloudWatch Logs)**  
    Error Type: {error_type}  
    Error Message: "{error_message}"  
    Additional Context:  
    - Function Name: {function_name}    

    ## **Resolution Steps (from DynamoDB)**  
    {resolution_steps}

    Your Task:
    1. Analyze the given error and determine the root cause.
    2. Generate a **meaningful function name** for the Lambda function.
    3. Generate a Python AWS Lambda function that resolves this error using the provided resolution steps.
    4. Please don't make it task id specific make it function_name specific
    5. Ensure the function:
       - Implements retry logic for transient failures.
       - Uses proper logging for debugging.
       - Follows AWS security best practices (least privilege IAM policies, no hardcoded credentials, etc.).
    6. Output the function name and Python code in the following format:
    
    Function Name: <Generated Function Name>
    ```python
    <Generated Lambda Code>
    ```
